# Next Word Prediction with RNN

This project involves training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to predict the next word in a sequence of text. The model is trained on a given dataset to learn the language patterns and predict the most probable word that follows a sequence of words.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following packages:
- tensorflow
- keras
- numpy
- pandas

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas
```
